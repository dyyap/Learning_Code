## Methodology

Critical Path Method generally is used for project planning. It is utilized to find the **Critical Task** or task that cannot be delayed or avoided. The **Critical Path** is the path that gives the minimum time that is required to complete the entire project. If the **Critical Tasks** are not done then the entire project is delayed.

### Steps
1. Identify the steps
2. Setup the Network
3. Forwards and Backwards Pass
4. Identify Path

### Jargon
- ES == Earliest Start
- EF == Earliest Finish
- LS == Latest Start
- LF == Latest Finish

*Slack* is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed. The Critical Path is the path that Slack is 0 for which the Earliest Start is Equivalent to the Latest Start and the Earliest Finish is Equivalent to the Latest Finish.
