## Signal

*Signal* is any physical quantity that varies as a function of time space or other variables.

Back in the analog days recording the signal was fairly complicated using tape.

The Analog Recording Process:
1. Sound Waves are picked up by a microphone and converted to small analog voltage called the audio signal
2. The audio signal "mimics" volume and frequency which is amplified
3. As the magnetic tape moves the intensity of the magnetic field is recorded on the tape
4. The magnetic tape then gets converted into an electrical signal and hten applied to the linear amplifier
5. The output then gets amplified through a speaker to then go to sound Waves

The Digital Recording Process is Simpler:
1. The soundwaves are converted to an electrical signal through a microphone and amplified to be used
2. The audio signal is converted to a series of numbers through the **Analog-to-Digital** converter or **ADC**
3. The numbers can be processed to do what you need
4. The digital signal is then converted from **Digital-to-Analog** or **DAC** and then transmitted out through a speaker

Digital is a hell of a lot smaller than Analog, tape is leverage

### Signal Math 

Signal Math is a big part of signals where knowing the x and y axis is really important as showing the difference and peaks is shown to be the most important as high peaks lead to detection most of all
Most of the time we focus on the signal as a signle independent variable. For this book the dependent variable is *amplitude* and the independent variable is *time*.  

There are two natural categories of signals, **continuous-time signals** and **discrete-time signals**

The speech signal is an example of a continuous time signal due to the fact that every value is defined by time. **Continuous-Time Signals** are also known as *analog signals* because the amplitude
is analogous (proportional to the physical quantity they represent)

**Discrete-Time Signals** are defined only at discrete times, however to process signals we only can use a sample of the data.
