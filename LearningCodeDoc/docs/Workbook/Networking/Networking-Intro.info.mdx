This is where I will put all of the tools and examples from different code bases from networking to the basis of algorithms.

## Tools

This is a multilangual guide of what I have learned because I have an awful memory and I want a place
that is streamlined for my needs, having as much of the code open-sourced as well as copyable when 
you put in the work first is here. This is tools or types of things I would use as a straight copy and 
paste. 

## Examples

This is more of an example where I'm looking and having a reference, this is where everything should be 
documented. 

## To-Do

Make a multilingual table
