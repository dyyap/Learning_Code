Encryption is the epitome of cryptography. The goal for encryption is to communicate in secrecy so that only the person who knows how to read it is able to read it.

## Shannon cipher

The Shannon Cipher is essentially a framework for encryption and decryption  

Where :  
k = key  
m = plaintext message  
c = ciphertext message  
and E is the encryption function of k and m  
and D is the decryption function of k and c  

```
c = E(k,m)
m = D(d,c)
```

**Suppose**:  
Alice and Bob want to send a message to each other.  
They both decide on a **Key** that only they both know.   
Then Alice **Encrypts** her message with the **Key**.  
Then she sends her message to Bob. Assuming that the messsage was the same message that Alice sent and it was not tampered in transit then Bob can use the shared **Key** and **Decrypt** the message.

### One-Time Pad
A **one-time pad** is a Shannon cipher E = (E,D), where the **Keys, Messages, and Ciphertext** are bit strings of the **Same Length**.

## Types of Ciphers  
### Substitution Cipher  
A substitution cipher in most cases exchange one character in the language that you are portraying into another language. 
For detailed examples of these click here.
### Permutation Cipher 
A permutation cipher is essentially scrambling the basic structure not replacing anything but confusing.
Example:

```
Plaintext:

Script is the best club on campus

Cipher text:

Pircst si eht sebt ulcb no mucpas

Cipher text no spaces:

Pircstsiehtsebtulcbnomucpas
```
This method will still have the same English letter frequencies however it eliminates the bigram and trigram frequencies.
