Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.
In the most general way language itself is a for of cryptography init of itself. If you do not want to have everyone in the room to know what you are talking about speak then talk in a language that you and the person you are communicating with only know. 
In this section we will try and break down as many of the cryptographic systems as possible with examples to be digested. 

## The Math

Cryptography as a whole involves in a lot of math. Most of the information included can be found in any "Discrete Mathematics" courses. 

### English Statistics

For most of the time in this book we will be using the English Language. If you are from another country or English is not your main language I apologize. 

If you have ever played the game "hangman", you instinctively choose letters that the most frequency in the English language. An early way of Cryptography was using **Substitution Cryptography**. 
This is a cryptographic method in which each letter is substituted for another letter. Examples of this are the Caesar Cipher or the Vigen√®re Cipher.

Using the above graph if you find out what letters appear in the **plaintext** most often chances are they correlate to the above graph. 
You can then apply the same method to **Bigrams** and **Trigrams**

Another characteristic of English is the **Index of Coincidence**. It essentially is the probability in a given text, 
if all of the letters were put in a hat how likely is it that the letters are both the same and in the English Language is is about .06.
So if you use the **Index of Coincidence** on a cipher text and it gives .06. It is most likely a substitution cipher.
