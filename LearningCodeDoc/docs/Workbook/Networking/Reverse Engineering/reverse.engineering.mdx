To start go to the Reverse Engineering Tools section and download ghidra or Ida pro. 

## x86 x64

To start on reverse engineering using IDA pro or any decompiler you need to know the inner workings of the x86 language. 
x86 is an Assembly type language and if you haven't taken it yet try and learn MIPS

In the Intel Processor there are two modes of handling: **Real** and **Protected**

The hierarchy of privilege of this system is based off of a **Ring Model**. Where there are "Rings" from 0-3 where ring 0 is the highest level privilege
These rings are coded in the cs register and is also known as the **Current Privilege Level**.
Whilst in the protected handling mode there are 9 x86 registers that are really common

```
EAX :: This is the Accumulator; Used for Arithmetic, I/O, etc
EBX :: Base Pointer
ECX :: Counter in Loops; Gets some interrupt value
EDX :: Data Register 
EDI :: Destination Register
ESI :: Source Index; String and Array copying
EBP :: Stack Base Pointer; Base Address of the stack
ESP :: Stack Pointer; Top Address of the stack
EIP :: Index Pointer; This is read only
EFLAGS :: Tells the status of Arithmetic Operations
ZF :: Zero Flag

```

Some data types of x86 are:
- **Bytes** : 8-bits : AL, BL, CL
- **Words** : 16-bits: AX, BX, CX
- **Double Words**  : 32-bits: EAX, EBX, ECX
- **Quad Words** : 64-bits: this does not exist in X86 architecture however it can be just two Double Words

### Instruction Set  

There are 5 main types of instructions:
1. Immediate to Register
2. Register to Register
3. Immediate to Memory
4. Register to Memory OR Memory to Register
5. Memory to Memory

In the first 4 there are 3 main instructions
1. Read the data from memory to a register (LDR)
2. Add one to the register (ADD)
3. Write register to memory (STR)
